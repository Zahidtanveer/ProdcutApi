Test case:
We are looking for problem solvers and motivated candidates.
As for that, we would like you to do a project so we can understand how you code, your thinking
and your amazing technical skills.
The goal is to create an inventory with :

● Products
○ Name

○ Description
○ Category name
○ Weighted or Non Weighted
○ Product Status (Sold, inStock, Damaged)

Using DDD, SQL server, EF Core for the database provider, .Net core, no UI needed.
Create 3 APIs

2) Change the status of a product
3) Sell a product
Personal initiatives or additional suggestions are recommended and will be taken into
consideration.
